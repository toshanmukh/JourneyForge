# JourneyForge_Application

We all face the challenge to decide what to do next â€“ be it in our career or learning journey. We don't have clarity or the current industry requirements/tractions to support our decisions.
We research or ask people and get convoluted opinions. Having a System which provides us with all the information to create a specific career and learning journey will always be beneficial.
Career Pathway System takes the guesswork out of exploring career and learning opportunities for students, parents, educators, career seekers, or any other stakeholders across industries and domains.
